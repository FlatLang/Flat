Flat Programming Language
===========================

### Flat Organization Build Status:
[![Status Badges](https://flatlang.org/api/badges.svg?nocache=true)](https://flatlang.org/api/github-status)

A high-level multi-paradigm programming language used as an intermediary between transpilation.

### This repository is _DEPRECATED_.

Because I had started this project over a decade ago when I was very early in my programming experience, the code in this repository is mostly terrible spaghetti code. It does not reflect the stability of and/or the aspired architecture of the Flat language project. If you find the code repulsive, you can join me in shaming myself for writing such awful code that I have to frequently debug through to keep a stable build and make any form of steady progress.

...however, this repository is still under active development because it is the only current working compiler. The compiler is currently being rewritten into several different modules, written in the Flat language itself:

* [Flat-Compiler](https://github.com/FlatLang/Flat-Compiler) - Includes all of the front-end/middle-end/back-end compiler components and utilities and provides the CLI for compiling Flat code
* [Flat-AST](https://github.com/FlatLang/Flat-AST) - Defines the Flat AST structure
* [Flat-Lexer](https://github.com/FlatLang/Flat-Lexer) - The new lexer engine
* [Parser-Core](https://github.com/FlatLang/Parser-Core) - The new generic code parser engine (for all languages that have an implemented grammar)
* [Flat-Parser](https://github.com/FlatLang/Flat-Parser) - The Flat language grammar definition for Parser-Core
* [Flat-Writer](https://github.com/FlatLang/Flat-Writer) - The new generic code generator/writer engine
* [Flat-Compiler-Models](https://github.com/FlatLang/Flat-Compiler-Models) - Common models used throughout the compiler modules
